Reading and writing is essential because all programs are typed in, so a programmer should be able to express ideas in written code.
Attention to details is very important because even a small typo will ruin good program.
Spotting differences is important because in order to troubleshoot or to improve a code small changes need to be implemented, and by spotting those differences one can be efficient at it.
